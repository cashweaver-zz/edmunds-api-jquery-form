# Car Info from Edmunds API

> HTML/CSS/JS

## Instructions

1. Add your API key in `main.js` at `const ourAPIKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE'`
2. Done!

## Notes

**Potential bugs**

My API key with Edmunds ran out rather quickly (25 calls per day will do that)
and I wasn't able to successfully test the final `Submit`. I suspect it's 95% of
the way there, if not 100%, as it's working perfectly with the mock API calls I
added for testing.
